Processing scheme for time series of height differences
=======================================================

Notes
-----
keep separated files (do no merge) as long as possible.
The more (and smaller) files the better for parallel (and serial) processing!
See the README.txt file in the data folders.

General processing
------------------
1. read raw IDR/WDR (parallel)... ok
2. convert to HDF5 (parallel)... ok
3. apply mask (parallel)... ok
4. sepparate tracks by flags (parallel)... ok
5. separate time: years, seasons, months... ok
6. separate in sectors w/overlap in lon (fast operation)... ok

Specific processing
-------------------
9.  filter data: shelf/land/ocean/buff & GLA specific [filtflags.py, filtgla.py]... ok
10. merge times (check if it's too much data) [mpi_merge.py]... ok
11. separate asc/des FLAGS in different files for 'x2sys' (much faster!) [filttracks.py]... ok
12. HDF5 to BIN for 'x2sys' (fast operation)... ok
13. find crossovers [mpi_ntasks.py, mpi_x2sys.py]. Warning: lon -/+180 is changed to 0/360!... ok
14. predict tides: OTPSm, check struct idr/gla! (on Triton)... ok
15. merge ad/da crossovers [mpi_merge.py, mpi_merge2.py] code_ok... ok
16. average bins (and remove sector overlaps): xovers -> grid (read code header) [x2grid.py], [1] code_ok... ok
17. join all subgrids in time/space (serial, slow) [gridjoin.py] code_ok... ok
[apply ICESat biases here!]
18. average time series: grid-cells (serial, very slow; read code header) [averagets2.py] code_ok... ok
19. independent backscatter correction (serial, fast) [backscatter3.py] code_ok... ok
20. merge satellites (serial, extremely fast) [mergesats2.py] code_ok... ok
21. cross calibration (serial, slow) [xcalib2.py] code_ok... ok
22. error/nobs propagation (serial, slow) [xcalib3.py] code_ok... ok
23. cross-calibration offset (serial, fast) [getoffset.py] code_ok... ok
24. joint backscatter correction (serial, slow) [backscatter2.py] code_ok... ok  #TODO: NOT NEEDED FOR NOW
25. post processing [postproc.py] code_ok... ok
    - cleanup bad ts
    - filter out step-changes
    - filter out peaks (3 std from the trend)
    - filter out uncomplete ts
26. add backscatter error to 2d tseries error [bs_error.py] (serial, fast)
27. map area of each grid cell (serial, slow) [areacell.py] -> only once!
30. map area of each ice shelf (serial, fast) [areashelf.py] -> only once!
31. map density/thickness/Z-H of each grid cell (serial, medium) [icedensity.py] -> only once!
32. fit polynomial trends (serial, fast) [trendfit.py] -> dh/dt map
33. apply corrections to 2d field: SL and IB (serial, fast) [trendcorr.py] -> dh/dt map
34. apply corrections to 2d series: SL and IB (serial, fast) [trendcorr3.py] -> 2d tseries 
35. calculate bootstrap errors for 2d fields and series (serial, very slow) [bootstrap_errors2.py] -> 2d tseries and map
36. interpolate and integrate values for each ice shelf [integrate_const2.py] -> table
37. generate corrections for full-ice-shelf ts: SL and IB (serial, fast) [trendcorr2.py] -> table
38. calculate full-ice-shelf time series (serial, slow) [tseries_shelves.py] -> 1d tseries
39. calculate bootstrap errors for full-ice-shelf ts (serial, medium) [bootstrap_errors.py] -> table
40. fit polynomial trends (serial, fast) [trendfit3.py] -> table
41. calculate average rate and accel. for 1990s and 2000s (series, fast) [average_rate_accel_boot.py] -> table

Visualization
-------------
1. create file with multiple layers (2d arrays, for time dimension) [postproc.py] (for XDMF)
2. create XDMF for data/error/coord to visualize in ParaView [writexdmf.py]
3. map dh/dt and error [mapdhdt.py, maperr.py]
4. map values to a bar chart [chart.py]
5. plot time series [tsshelves.py, tsregions.py]


[1] do not apply 'iterative' std to any satellite!


Criteria for data rejection
---------------------------

Raw elevations:

1. return waveform without leading edge
2. waveform with specular shape
3. any geophysical correction missing
4. less then 3 km from any boundary

Crossovers on each bin:

5. absolute value greater than 15 m
6. absolute value greater than 3 standard deviations

Data points in the time series:

7. any point that is a step change greater than 3m
8. any point that is greater than 3 standard deviations from the trend

Time series as a whole:

9. time series with cross-calibration offset greater than 1.5 m 
10. time series with standard deviation greater than 2 m
11. time series with less than 70% of its data points (for 18-years)
12. time series "obviously wrong" by visual inspection
